This ![animated popup](animated_popup.py) is created by iterating through a list of images. This is good to use for a process where the time or sequence is unknown.

This ![text loading popup](character_loading.py) is animated with a simple sequence of text options in a while loop. This is simpler than the picture animation, but is used for a similar purpose... when time or sequence of events is unknown.

This ![ascii character loading popup](ascii_progress.py) is animated by with simple ascii characters in a while loop. This is an old school look, but can be used with or without a GUI. Also, this is best used when there is a defined time or sequence of events that can be calculated.
